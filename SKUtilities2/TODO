SKU_Buttons needs a toggle button
SKU_Buttons needs a slider

shapenode needs to accomodate for retina displays when rendering

multiline node needs copy zone and might need retina rendering
skbuttons probably need copy zone

skview for mac needs multibutton support

perhaps add time updates to singleton IN ADDITION to c functions (ability to track delta etc automatically)

might wanna add archiving support?


sknode category should break input down into a hierarchy of calls
	platform dependent calls "absoluteInputBegan" and "relativeInputBegan" should then call "inputBegan"
		all should be accessible by derivatives
	remove siriRemote calls (become relative)


rename category method calls to start with SKU or something (avoid namespace conflicts)
