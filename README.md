# SKUtilities 2

## Overview

I have learned a lot since I first started my original utilities package, and decided it'd be better to start anew than to try to fix things from the previous version. However, this is still a work in progress. I would **strongly recommend** that you do **NOT** use it right now as it is still under heavy development and things are VERY liable to change and break your workflow. Feel free to copy snippets to use in your own code though. I can't break things that I can't change!

### Documentation
Everything is still a work in progress, but documentation is and will be available [here](http://mredig.github.io/SKUtilities2_Doc/).
